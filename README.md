# Divvy Data and Analytics Engineering Project

## Purpose of project

The project is to build an end-to-end Batch Data Engineering pipeline for an Analytics Dashboard. 

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end data pipeline.

## Problem statement

- Develop a dashboard with atleast two tiles
- Select a dataset of interest
- Create a pipeline for processing this dataset and putting it to a datalake
- Create a pipeline for moving the data from the lake to a data warehouse
- Transform the data in the data warehouse: prepare it for the dashboard
- Building a dashboard to visualize the data

## The data
The data is provided by Divvy Bikeshare and contains information about bike rides in Washington DC. Downloadable files are available on the following [data link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) The data used for this project is from January 2023 to date.

## Technologies used

- Docker:- Containerization of applications 
- Google Cloud Storage GCS - Data Lake for storage
- Google Cloud BigQuery - Data warehouse
- Kestra - Workflow orchestration
- dbt- Analytics Engineering
- Google Looker studio - Data Visualization

## Steps to reproduce project:

Important: This project is intended to be easily reproducible. This section will give a thorough breakdown of how to reproduce this project

## 1) Pre-requisites
- Install Docker
  
## 2) Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Setup up GCP free account if you don't have an account. Free USD$300expires after 90 days.
- Create a new project and take note of the project ID.
- Set up service account. Select Bigquery Admin, Compute Admin and storage Admin Roles for this project.
- Once account is created, create and download the key file. This will be used to authenticate google services. This will be needed for Kestra and dbt setup.

## 3) Setup Kestra
- Setup working Environment either a VM on GCP or on your local machine. Open your terminal, clone the project repo and then launch Kestra UI
  
```
  git clone https://github.com/kabiromohd/Divvy-Analytics-Engineering-Project.git

  cd Divvy-Analytics-Engineering-Project/Orchestration-kestra/

  docker-compose up

```

- Run the below command to load the already prepared project YAML flows into the Kestra application.

```
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/flows/import -F fileUpload=@flows/04_gcp_kv.yaml
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/flows/import -F fileUpload=@flows/05_gcp_setup.yaml
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/flows/import -F fileUpload=@flows/09_gcp_capstone1
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/flows/import -F fileUpload=@flows/09_gcp_scheduled_capstone1

```

- Open the Kestra UI on https://localhost:8080
  
Run the following inside of Kestra UI

- Insert: GCP Service Account credentials in 04_gcp_kv.yaml flow.

- Execute: 04_gcp_kv.yaml and 05_gcp_setup.yaml flows to setup your GCS - Datalake and BigQuery - Data Warehouse
  
- Execute: 09_gcp_capstone1, if you desire to ingest monthly data from the API into GCS (Datalake) and BigQuery (Data Warehouse) one by one.
  
- 09_gcp_scheduled_capstone1 to ingest data from the API into GCS (Datalake) and BigQuery (Data Warehouse) via a backfill. Note that a trigger has been setup in the yml flow to ingest data as new data becomes available on the API

## 4) Setup dbt Cloud for Analytics Engineering 

For this project a dbt cloud option was selected for dbt setup. Please follow the following steps:

- Setting up dbt and connect to your BigQuery

- Open a free developer dbt cloud account following [this link](https://www.getdbt.com/signup)
  
- Once you have logged in into dbt cloud you will be prompt to create a new project

![dbt setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7318b7b3-a0e9-4105-b1a6-2bcccccdd7e9)

- Initiating the project directory 

-  There are a number of schemas and SQL file that have been created in dbt for the purpose of the project, copy them into the appropriate folders

- run dbt build and you get the following DAG

![project DAG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c1db069-f233-414a-b544-0424d4a9dfdc)

- After a succesful dbt build run, you should have the below.

![dbt build output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4beb04ca-72c3-4ec2-984d-034b04cc3ffb)

- On the dbt dashboard go to deploy code on dbt cloud.
  
- Create a production environment, create a job and trigger a job manually.

- You can also setup a cron job to implement the job at certain intervals as in below:

![cron job](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fdf7ee4-1ca7-4436-871a-cc95ea7d163e)

You should get the below:

## 4) Setup Google Looker Studio for Visualization

- Create Google Looker Studio via [this link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) 
- Select the bigquery connector and connect to the transformed data in BigQuery
- Start building dashboard using the available features in looker
- The live dashboard created can be viewed and interacted with [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/8ada8555-1ae0-44d5-ad13-ee739c61d1d8/page/H3ZEF)

## 5) Created Dashboard
